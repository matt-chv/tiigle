# tiigle
set of websites crawling, scraping and unsupervised clustering

## Architecture considerations
### Crawling and Scraping
Based on Scrapy

### Unsupervised Clustering
sources: 
* [unsupervised clustering of movies based on abstracts](http://brandonrose.org/clustering)
* [unsupervised clustering of news articles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01175.pdf)

## Output
1. Clustered webpages and websites by content
2. structured search (Google on steroids)
